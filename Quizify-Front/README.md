React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
About the Project
This is a full-stack quiz-creating web application where users can create two types of quizzes: Q&A and Poll. After creating a quiz, the user can generate a public link that can be shared with anyone. Participants can take the quiz through the link, and their responses will be stored and displayed to the quiz creator. The application includes both authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to quiz management and results. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
